Create notion main landing page for my Agentic ai sub-repo and then second page in notion for gist as our readme for Agentic ai commands ((get (details)//send (messages))
To create Notion pages for your Agentic AI sub-repo and its commands, I need more information about your desired structure and content. I can't directly interact with Notion, so I will provide you with the content you can copy and paste into Notion to create the pages. You'll then need to format it within Notion using its features. **1. Notion Main Landing Page (Agentic AI Sub-repo):** This page will serve as a high-level overview of your Agentic AI project. Please provide details on what you want to include, such as: * **Project Title:** (e.g., Agentic AI - Core) * **Brief Description:** A concise summary of the project's purpose and functionality. * **Key Features:** A bulleted list of the main features. * **Technology Stack:** The programming languages and libraries used. * **Installation Instructions:** A brief overview of how to set up and run the project (or a link to more detailed instructions). * **Links:** To the GitHub repository, the command reference page (Notion page 2), and any other relevant resources. Here's a template you can adapt: ```markdown # Agentic AI - Core **Brief Description:** [Insert a concise description of your Agentic AI project here] **Key Features:** * Feature 1 * Feature 2 * Feature 3 **Technology Stack:** Python, [list other technologies] **Installation:** [Brief installation instructions or link to detailed instructions] **Links:** * [GitHub Repository Link](https://github.com/calvinsthomas/AgenticAI) * [Command Reference](Notion Page 2 Link) ``` **2. Notion Second Page (Agentic AI Commands):** This page will document the commands for your Agentic AI system. Based on your provided Gist, it seems you want to focus on `get (details)` and `send (messages)` commands. Please provide more detailed information about these commands, including: * **Command Syntax:** The exact format of the command (e.g., `get details <parameter>`). * **Parameters:** A description of each parameter, including data types and allowed values. * **Return Values:** What data does each command return? * **Examples:** Illustrative examples showing how to use each command. * **Error Handling:** How the commands handle errors. Here's a template based on the information you've given: ```markdown # Agentic AI Command Reference ## `get (details)` **Syntax:** `get details [parameter]` **Parameters:** * `[parameter]`: [Description of the parameter and its data type] **Return Values:** [Describe the data returned] **Example:** ``` get details user_id=123 ``` ## `send (messages)` **Syntax:** `send messages [parameters]` **Parameters:** * [Parameter 1]: [Description and data type] * [Parameter 2]: [Description and data type] **Return Values:** [Describe the data returned] **Example:** ``` send messages recipient=user123 message="Hello there!" ``` ``` Remember to replace the bracketed placeholders with your actual command details. Once you provide the specifics for each section, I can help refine these templates further. After filling out the templates, you can copy and paste this Markdown into Notion. You will then need to format the page within Notion using its features.
