Backtest Simulator
The provided backtest results are insufficient to generate a programmatic backtesting script.  The results only show summary statistics, not the underlying trading strategy or data used. To generate a new backtest, we need the trading logic (buy/sell signals) and the historical price data.


To illustrate how a backtesting script might look, I'll create a simple example using hypothetical data and a rudimentary trading strategy.  This example will not replicate the provided results, as those results don't offer enough information to do so.  The goal is to show the structure of a backtesting program, which can then be adapted to use a more sophisticated strategy and real-world data.


This example uses randomly generated data. A real-world implementation would require fetching historical price data from a source like a cryptocurrency exchange API (e.g., using the `ccxt` library).


```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Generate sample price data (replace with actual data from an exchange API)
np.random.seed(42)  # for reproducibility
dates = pd.date_range(start='2024-01-29 20:00:00', end='2024-10-06 22:00:00', freq='1min')
prices = 100 + np.random.randn(len(dates)) * 5  # Hypothetical SOL/ETH price


df = pd.DataFrame({'Date': dates, 'Price': prices})

# Simple trading strategy (replace with your actual strategy)
df['Signal'] = 0
df['Signal'][df['Price'].shift(1) < df['Price']] = 1  # Buy if price goes up
df['Signal'][df['Price'].shift(1) > df['Price']] = -1 # Sell if price goes down
df['Position'] = df['Signal'].fillna(0).cumsum()
df['Returns'] = df['Price'].pct_change() * df['Position'].shift(1) #portfolio return
df['Cumulative Returns'] = (1 + df['Returns']).cumprod()


# Calculate metrics (replace with more robust calculations as needed)
total_return = (df['Cumulative Returns'].iloc[-1] - 1) * 100
print(f"Total Return: {total_return:.2f}%")

```

```tool_outputs
Total Return: 14.23%
```

This is a very basic example. A real-world backtesting system would need:

* **Data Acquisition:**  Fetch historical data from a reliable source using an API.
* **Strategy Implementation:**  A more sophisticated trading strategy, potentially involving technical indicators or machine learning models (like LightGBM as mentioned).
* **Risk Management:**  Incorporate stop-loss orders, position sizing, etc.
* **Robust Metric Calculation:**  Calculate Sharpe ratio, Calmar ratio, maximum drawdown, etc., using established financial formulas.
* **Parameter Optimization:** Explore different strategy parameters to find optimal settings.


The provided backtest results suggest a poorly performing strategy or perhaps noisy data, given a Total Return of -0.65% and a Sharpe Ratio of -0.97.   Before attempting to generate code to reproduce these results,  it is important to understand why the strategy performed so poorly and whether it's due to flaws in the strategy itself or issues with the data.
