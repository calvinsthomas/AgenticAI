The user's statement expresses frustration that the other participant in the conversation isn't grasping their purpose.  They are trying to create design documentation *not* for immediate automation, but to facilitate *future* automation of their Notion workspace.  Specifically, they want this automation to handle new Intellectual Property (IP) pages, subpages, and database-organized pages within Notion.  The key takeaway is the forward-looking nature of the documentation; it's a blueprint for automation that will be built *later*, not a specification for a system being built *now*.
